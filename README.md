# AWS-Web-Scanner
This is an AWS [lambda function](https://github.com/JimSolomon/AWS-Web-Scanner/blob/main/lambda.py) that calls [docker image](https://github.com/JimSolomon/AWS-Web-Scanner/blob/main/Dockerfile) that runs by Fargate. Therefore, users can run web scan on AWS with higher speed, and users can also scan multiple target and store scan results on AWS such as S3 or DynamicDB for further investigation.


# Demo
Below is a scan result of a company.
